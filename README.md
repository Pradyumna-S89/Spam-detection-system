# Spam-detection-system
We have developed a spam detection system using python to detect and classify messages as spam or not spam for which we have used jupyter notebook via anaconda software. NLP and ML are involved and streamlit has been used for designing a web interface hereby removing the need to use external Web D for the interface.

Model was trained using Multinomial,Bernoulli,gaussian Naive Bayes model where 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing under train test split module 
As the model is trained on basic ham/spam classification dataset from kaggle it doesnt detect each and every single spam message. For convinience additional spam/non spam messages which arent a part of the training data but seemed to be correctly labelled by our model have been appended in a text file for usage

Also, a doc file containing our report and a power point presentation have been attached for readers to understand our project better.
Thank you for visiting this repository we hope you like our creation.
